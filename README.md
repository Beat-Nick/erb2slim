## erb2slim
A simple web app written in ruby to convert HTML/HAML/ERB to SLIM.

## Goal of Project
First I want to say thanks for using the site, I hope it helps makes your life a bit easier. I wanted a small project to test out the Sinatra framework and learn a bit of CSS and created [erb2slim](http://erb2slim.com/). The tool is built on top of the hardwork of many developers who have created libraries utilized for all coversions. Please note that I **do not maintain any of the libraries used for the conversions**. Any issues relating to badly formed code should go to their respective repo on GitHub. For anything else please feel free to open an issue and I'll take a look.

For easy reference I have linked the repos below:

* **Haml -> Slim:**   [Html2Haml ](https://github.com/slim-template/html2slim) && [Haml2Slim](https://github.com/slim-template/haml2slim)
* **Slim:**                 [Html2Slim](https://github.com/slim-template/html2slim)
* **Haml:**               [Html2Haml](https://github.com/haml/html2haml)
* **HTML Format:**  [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/)

I also utilized the following libraries for the code window and css framework:
* [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
* [Materalize](http://materializecss.com/)
